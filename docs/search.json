I showed my ticket to a helpful customs official and asked what to do and they said I’d have to go back through security at Terminal 5 by taking the lift to the train. And run because you don’t have any time. I got to security at Terminal 5 and was promptly asked to go to Terminal 2. I cleared security another sprint, lift, and train later and made it to my gate with minutes to spare.\nNicole’s flight landed before mine and we met at the hotel in Arlanda."

I followed SP83 around the north side of the lake. Sicilian roads, maybe Italian roads in general, are decided into three major classes outside of the municipal road system. “E” are major highways and bikes are not permitted, “SS” are state highways and generally well maintained, “SP” are provincial roads maintained by the provinces and local authorities. SP roads can transition from a narrow asphalt path to sand, coarse 2” gravels, etc. They also don’t appear to have any civil engineering requirements for road gradient. All this is to say that the SP route was scenic but also the most physically challenging 3 hours I have experienced.\nI stayed in near Nicosia, another stunning hill town. Tall cliffs are dotted with caves, which were home to many until the 1950s.\nCaves that people lived in within those rocky mounds."

    "text": "Woke up at 2am to load my bike and cycled 12km to the airport. I was the only person, (one rabbit), on the signed bike path to terminal 1. Purchased a bike box and a roll of tape for €25 at luggage services and loaded the box to the brim. The kind folks at Lufthansa baggage check coached me into saying that the box was 23kg, which is under the maximum of 25kg for this airline. It was definitely over the maximum weight and they knew it! The airport and security were empty and I got through security at 4:45am - a comfortable 3 hours early.\nCalled Alex in the airport. He has lettuce and potentially kale and spinach growing at home!\nArrived in Catania, Sicily, and biked to The Yard Hostel. Toured the streets, street market, monastery turned liberal / arts university, and cathedrals."

She gave us the local cycling scoop. Ærø was by far the best cycling of the trip with heaps of cycling dedicated infrastructure and businesses. We popped into Ærø Bryggeri, the local craft brewery, and met Nils, who was the previous director of the brewery and cigar shop. He was so kind and offered us a place to stay in one of the guest houses in his oceanfront farm. We stayed with two lovely young women from Hamburg and toured Nils organic farm and reestablished grassland."

    "text": "Nicole left for the airport around 6am. We were barely able to fit the packed bicycle box in the elevator. Our collective adventure has ended after almost 4 weeks and 1600km of dilly dallying.\nAn impressive 3 hours spent at the complimentary breakfast that included a spread of almost every breakfast food you can imagine. I also scored a sandwich for lunch and more instant coffee packets. I now have a collection of 17 instant coffee packets and will write a review on the best brand and roast once the scoring rubric is developed.\nBiked to the airport to inquire about bike boxes. The Luggage Service employees are delightful! The said they’d have a box for me ready at 3am. I said that they made my day and one attendant responded saying that I made his as well by being kind.\nHopped onto the bike path from the airport to my hotel, a direct and signed path, and was instantly being honked at and yelled at in German by a line of 6 or 7 cars. Perhaps I have watched too many WW2 movies but being yelled at in German is disconcerting. Turns out that they were trying to let me know I dropped my sweater. Thanks to all who took the time to honk and yell!"

It’s a UNESCO site and a fantastic stop. We then made our way to Faxe and met Kenn and Mille, A friend’s cousins. Kenn took us to an old water mill and windmill and the local lime mine."

Cool cool cool.\nJohanna also took us out for spaghetti ice. I was skeptical about it and still find it strange after trying it."

We had the beautiful property, zip line, go carts, etc. to ourselves. We picnicked on the lawn and did the Nicole booty buster workout, complete with deadlifts."

I wanted to see some of the Sicilian hill towns, as they are described as some of the most beautiful in Italy. I didn’t take the climbing into account and ended up staying 15km from my planned campsite at La Dolce Vita b&b on Lago Pazzillo.\nStopped in Regalbuto on the way, the most beautiful town I have seen so far. There were older men walking lengths arm in arm in the main square. Two stopped me, shook my hand, and called me a lion! It was just what I needed after a challenging day riding. Then I went to a store for food and the grocery store was closed. Another pair of old men walked over to me and said “sandwich”? I nodded and they escorted me down the very centre of the road to an open “bar”. Turns out it was a bakery. Got two huge pizza bun things and 3 cookies."
