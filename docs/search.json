An elderly woman appeared to be having a stroke or seizure. The EMTs took her from the plane at London Heathrow.\nI didn’t pay attention to airport signage and cleared customs into the UK instead of heading to my gate. I showed my ticket to a helpful customs official and asked what to do and they said I’d have to go back through security at Terminal 5 by taking the lift to the train. And run because you don’t have any time. I got to security at Terminal 5 and was promptly asked to go to Terminal 2. I cleared security another sprint, lift, and train later and made it to my gate with minutes to spare.\nNicole’s flight landed before mine and we met at the hotel in Arlanda."

I toured the castle, a palimpsest built between 1300-1600, used mostly as a prison and torcher chamber. It was creepy. Nicole opted out, sat in the sun and had a coffee and pastry. We ate lunch at Dirty Taco and I almost had a run in with peanuts. Peanuts on tacos? Another strong headwind until Hallsberg. Burgers, beer, and premier league before bed."

We reluctantly left Pia and Mats after our island tour and after they gave us parting gifts - cheese cutters, which are fantastic and which we will put to use!
