An elderly woman appeared to be having a stroke or seizure. The EMTs took her from the plane at London Heathrow.\nI didn’t pay attention to airport signage and cleared customs into the UK instead of heading to my gate. I showed my ticket to a helpful customs official and asked what to do and they said I’d have to go back through security at Terminal 5 by taking the lift to the train. And run because you don’t have any time. I got to security at Terminal 5 and was promptly asked to go to Terminal 2. I cleared security another sprint, lift, and train later and made it to my gate with minutes to spare.\nNicole’s flight landed before mine and we met at the hotel in Arlanda."
