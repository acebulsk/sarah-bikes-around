Met Emma, Nicole’s exchange student, at her house for breakfast. What a spread! Emma and her boyfriend, Fabian, toured us around her beighbourhood biked with us to the train station. Our train was late and we missed our connection but go into Frankfurt with time to pack up Nicole’s bike with cardboard from the recycling bin and have beers. Our last day of cycling together.
