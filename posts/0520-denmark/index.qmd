Took the ferry from Svendborg to Ærøskøbing. We met a lovely local at the ferry terminal who happened to be a cycling enthusiast with a collection of 15 bikes. She gave us the local cycling scoop. Ærø was by far the best cycling of the trip with heaps of cycling dedicated infrastructure and businesses. We popped into Ærø Bryggeri, the local craft brewery, and met Nils, who was the previous director of the brewery and cigar shop. He was so kind and offered us a place to stay in one of the guest houses in his oceanfront farm. We stayed with two lovely young women from Hamburg and toured Nils organic farm and reestablished grassland.
