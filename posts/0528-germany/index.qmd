Nicole left for the airport around 6am. We were barely able to fit the packed bicycle box in the elevator.  Our collective adventure has ended after almost 4 weeks and 1600km of dilly dallying. 

An impressive 3 hours spent at the complimentary breakfast that included a spread of almost every breakfast food you can imagine. I also scored a sandwich for lunch and more instant coffee packets. I now have a collection of 17 instant coffee packets and will write a review on the best brand and roast once the scoring rubric is developed. 

Biked to the airport to inquire about bike boxes. The Luggage Service employees are delightful! The said theyâ€™d have a box for me ready at 3am. I said that they made my day and one attendant responded saying that I made his as well by being kind. 

Hopped onto the bike path from the airport to my hotel, a direct and signed path, and was instantly being honked at and yelled at in German by a line of 6 or 7 cars. Perhaps I have watched too many WW2 movies but being yelled at in German is disconcerting. Turns out that they were trying to let me know I dropped my sweater. Thanks to all who took the time to honk and yell!
