We camped in Madeskov for free, including hot showers, because we were the first Canadians to stay at the site. We ferried from Sonderborg Denmark to Rendsburg, Germany. Food is much less expensive in Germany!

Flelensburg harbour is filled with wooden sailboats and boasts a rum museum. The town was made rich by the sugar and slave trade.
