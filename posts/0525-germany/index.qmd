Fantastic riding from Bremen to Neinburg along quiet roads and MUPs. We spent hours at local restaurant drinking beer (Nicole) and fruity cocktails (Sarah). When we arrived at the campground it was gated and didn’t look open for the season. Turns out it was a Children’s summer camp but the nice owner let us camp and use the facilities. We had the beautiful property, zip line, go carts, etc. to ourselves. We picnicked on the lawn and did the Nicole booty buster workout, complete with deadlifts.
