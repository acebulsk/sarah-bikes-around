Woke up at 2am to load my bike and cycled 12km to the airport. I was the only person, (one rabbit), on the signed bike path to terminal 1. Purchased a bike box and a roll of tape for â‚¬25 at luggage services and loaded the box to the brim. The kind folks at Lufthansa baggage check coached me into saying that the box was 23kg, which is under the maximum of 25kg for this airline. It was definitely over the maximum weight and they knew it! The airport and security were empty and I got through security at 4:45am - a comfortable 3 hours early. 

Called Alex in the airport. He has lettuce and potentially kale and spinach growing at home!

Arrived in Catania, Sicily, and biked to The Yard Hostel. Toured the streets, street market, monastery turned liberal / arts university, and cathedrals.
