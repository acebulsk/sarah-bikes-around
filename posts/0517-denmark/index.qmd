Signe recommended three bakeries and we naturally tried all three in one morning. We rode out of Copenhagen and met up with a cycle touring couple, Marie and Jean Paul. They plan a trip each year and had ridden from Brittany.

The coastal riding in Denmark is beautiful. We stopped at Stevns Klint, where a meteor hit earth and killed dinosaurs. It’s a UNESCO site and a fantastic stop. We then made our way to Faxe and met Kenn and Mille, A friend’s cousins. Kenn took us to an old water mill and windmill and the local lime mine.
