We contemplated catching a train to Gothenburg as the highway riding hadn’t been the nicest or what we expected. Instead, we drank a bunch of coffee and biked towards Örebro. I toured the castle, a palimpsest built between 1300-1600, used mostly as a prison and torcher chamber. It was creepy. Nicole opted out, sat in the sun and had a coffee and pastry. We ate lunch at Dirty Taco and I almost had a run in with peanuts. Peanuts on tacos? Another strong headwind until Hallsberg. Burgers, beer, and premier league before bed.
