Another sunny day! We forgot it was Sunday and had a challenging time finding food. We slept on a picnic table outside a coop that had the largest packages of wasa crackers I have ever seen. Biked to Mariestad on Lake Vanern in that strong, westerly headwind. It looks like cottage country. More premier league before a lot of stretching and bed.
