We rode from Faxe, where the famous Faxe Kondi soda is from, and caught the train in Odense. We toured Egeskov Castle and itâ€™s many gardens. It would be a cute date spot with a picnic.

A team of contractors was replacing a thatched roof. Those roofs are my favourite thing about Denmark! They use a scathe-looking tool to trim the straw!
