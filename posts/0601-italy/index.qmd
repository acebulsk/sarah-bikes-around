A scenic bike to Mistretta, followed by a 940m decent, (zero pedalling!), through olive groves and flowers to the ocean.  It was an easy peasy cycle along the water to a nice camping space on the beach

Around 4pm I biked back to a grocery store and it started to rain. Luckily I had my rain gear! The locals thought I was an alien cycling in the rain and many waved me into their sheltered spaces.
