Lox for breakfast and the tastiest I have ever had! Most interesting biking day and we have linked onto a EuroVelo route that is under development. Met a 77 year old man who had a new looking bike that he had ridden over 30,000km on. Biked through the UNESCO Platabergens geo park. Exceptionally beautiful sedimentary formations backed by lake Vanern.
