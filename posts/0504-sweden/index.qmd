I toured one of the oldest churches in Sweden, so the sign read, before breakfast and heading out. We biked to Anundshög, a 500-900 ACE Viking archaeological site. It is Sweden’s largest burial mound and includes tumuli, a mound of earth raised over a grave (a Viking ship in this case) and stone ships. The ships outline what would have been large ships used as tombs for Viking kings. We rode to Arboga with another strong head wind to Arboga and had Swedish meatballs for dinner.
