Woke from camping in Askim and toodled along the coast. Beautiful and relaxing riding until we got our first flat! Nic changed her tire while I ate cake and drank coffee. The Swedish have this lovely tradition called “fika”, a coffee and/or cake break. We are strong proponents and often fika more than once per day.
