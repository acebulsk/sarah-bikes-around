Toured the Nordic-Norman and Byzantine cathedral in Cefalu, another UNESCO World Heritage Site. Yes, that is correct by the way. The architecture is influenced by the French and English but was drafted and designed by Byzantine architects. So cool. Followed that tour by an unexpected beer fest along the beach, featuring many gluten free beers that were surprisingly delicious!
