We hit 1000km today and made it to Copenhagen! The cycling is something to get used to. Yes, the infrastructure is fantastic for cyclists. Yes, cars and locals move very quickly and aren’t all that happy about panniers. We toured Free Town Christiania, a really interesting with a flat governance structure and its highest authority being the community meeting. It’s also where to buy weed in Copenhagen. I’m not sure why I assumed weed was legal in Denmark but it’s not! Fee town: https://www.christiania.org/info/pages-in-english/
