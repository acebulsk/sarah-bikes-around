Biked from Grästorp to Kungälv. We cycled through another park and table mountain Kungajaktmuseet. A longer day than we had expected and ended with a strong headwind. I felt like I was going to be blown off my bike for a few hours but Nicole coached me through it. Ended the day with Pia and Mats, two unbelievably gracious hosts in Kungälv. We had a delicious dinner and went to bed early.
