I decided to follow a route from a Sicilian cycle guiding company. At the time, I didn’t realize that it was marketed towards mountain e-bikes. I followed SP83 around the north side of the lake. Sicilian roads, maybe Italian roads in general, are decided into three major classes outside of the municipal road system. “E” are major highways and bikes are not permitted, “SS” are state highways and generally well maintained, “SP” are provincial roads maintained by the provinces and local authorities. SP roads can transition from a narrow asphalt path to sand, coarse 2” gravels, etc. They also don’t appear to have any civil engineering requirements for road gradient. All this is to say that the SP route was scenic but also the most physically challenging 3 hours I have experienced.

I stayed in near Nicosia, another stunning hill town. Tall cliffs are dotted with caves, which were home to many until the 1950s. 

Caves that people lived in within those rocky mounds.
