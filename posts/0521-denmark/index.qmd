Rode from Niel’s place along mostly gravel roads to Soby to catch the Ferry from Aero to Als.  The route took us past many thatched manor houses with small farms. Almost everything is digital in Denmark, including ferry tickets and bookings. We couldn’t book using the app and asked the local harbour master for help. The ordeal resulted in Nicole’s credit card being flagged for fraud and us walking aboard without paying. We decided to have a short ride after a few flats. Nicole spent first bit of the evening changing tubes and tires around and the second bit tasting beers at the local brewery.
