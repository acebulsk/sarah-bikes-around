Johanna prepared us a delicious and decadent breakfast then took us on a tour of Bremen. As an excellent host, she managed to take us to all of the UNESCO sites. Personally, if I see a UNESCO site I am a very happy traveller. The Town Hall and the statue of Roland on the marketplace are representations of civic autonomy and sovereignty dating to the 1400s. Cool cool cool. 

Johanna also took us out for spaghetti ice. I was skeptical about it and still find it strange after trying it.
