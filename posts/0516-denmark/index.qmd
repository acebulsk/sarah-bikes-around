We toured the NY Carlsberg Glyptotek. Very cool museum with Danish painters, Roman sculpture, and a large ancient Egyptian exhibition. Lots of colonialism and lots of exceptional preservation work.


I toured the Danish Architecture Centre. It has a dedicated area to one of my favourite urbanists, Jan Gehl. He systematized a way to make a bomber city even better and you can feel it in the streets. 


We met up with Signe, a friend of a friend, for dinner and learned some interesting Copenhagen facts. The little mermaid was on loan in China for a period and thousands of folks have photos with a fake mermaid.
