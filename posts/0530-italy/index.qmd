Took the wrong way out of Catania and started climbing Etna up to 1100m. Hung a left towards my route. I wanted to see some of the Sicilian hill towns, as they are described as some of the most beautiful in Italy. I didn’t take the climbing into account and ended up staying 15km from my planned campsite at La Dolce Vita b&b on Lago Pazzillo. 


Stopped in Regalbuto on the way, the most beautiful town I have seen so far. There were older men walking lengths arm in arm in the main square. Two stopped me, shook my hand, and called me a lion! It was just what I needed after a challenging day riding. Then I went to a store for food and the grocery store was closed. Another pair of old men walked over to me and said “sandwich”? I nodded and they escorted me down the very centre of the road to an open “bar”. Turns out it was a bakery. Got two huge pizza bun things and 3 cookies.
