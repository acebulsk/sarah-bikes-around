Pia and Mats took us to Marstrand, a small island near Kungälv, north of Gothenburg. According to the informational signage, Marstrand became a playground for the rich and famous after King Oscar II visited and built his summer home. It’s beautiful. We reluctantly left Pia and Mats after our island tour and after they gave us parting gifts - cheese cutters, which are fantastic and which we will put to use! We rode through Gothenburg and found a campsite.
