German trains are an absolute dream! Real humans at the ticket booth and no stairs to board in the bike compartment. Took the train from Rendsburg to Hamburg. We visited Speicherstadt and the adjacent Kontorhaus district - UNESCO designated warehouse districts along the Elbe. We hopped back on the train to Bremen, where we met up with Johanna, a friend of Nicoleâ€™s who took us stinky travellers in and made us delicious pizza. We stayed up until 1am - a personal best for the trip!
